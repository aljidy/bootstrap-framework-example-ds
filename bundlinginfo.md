# Frameworks

- Please shout if you're confused

- Frameworks are built to purpose, if your need fits the purpose, you're good (blogging) - compare with facebook
- Frameworks are not always good idea 

## Differences 
- JQuery
- [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)
- Framework is quite constraining
- React is an example of framework
[https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx](https://reactjs.org/redirect-to-codepen/introducing-jsx)
- Note the weird syntax

## Frameworks 
- Speed of development (Reinvent the wheel) 
  - Lots of the web is very similar
- Niche skillsets 
  - Accessibility, Form validation
- Lack of control
- They're not always good 
- Anyone can think why they suck?
  - Slow to download 
  - Overlapping frameworks, more to learn
  - Pick the right one 

## CSS Frameworks
- Need to learn HOW to use it
- CSS class names (how do you know how to use one~?)
   - Read docs 
   - What if it's bad

## Bootstrap and what it does 

- Look at each component
- The class names are the magic bits (headings)
- Happy with classes? 
    - How many classes are there?
- Override your own styles
- (Play with it in the inspector)

- Containers/Grid are really important

## Bundling donwloaded assets

`<link href="bootstrap-5.0.0-beta2-dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

`<script src="bootstrap-5.0.0-beta2-dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>`

- Local more complicated, more maintaince 
- Offline
- More control

## Bundling CDN assets

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0-beta2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-b5kHyXgcpbZJO/tY9Ul7kGkf1S0CWuKcCD38l8YkeH8z8QjE0GmW1gYU5S9FOnJ0" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`

 - Easier
 - Less maintace to keep up to date
 - Usually can copy paste the code
 - Not always available
 - "Faster"
 - Code completion
